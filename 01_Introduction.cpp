/*
    -> The word “polymorphism” means having many forms where "Poly" means "Many" and "Morph" means "Form".
    ->  It is the ability of the objects to take different forms. 
    -> It indicates that the form of a member function can be changed at run-time. Such member functions are called "Virtual Functions" and the corresponding class is called "Polymorphic Class".
    -> The "Virtual function" allow programmers to declare functions in a base class and redefine the same with same name in its derieved classes.
    -> The additional feature of a "Virtual function" is that the compiler and linker will guarantee the execution ofthe correct function associated with the objects of each of the derived class at run-time.
